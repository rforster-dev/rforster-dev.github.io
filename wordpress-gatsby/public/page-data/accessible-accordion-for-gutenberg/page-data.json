I must have spent hours, days looking for 1, and I found a few‚Ä¶however, they all used the <code><details></code> and <code><summary></code> tag, which if you are in the know ‚Äì<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://daverupert.com/2019/12/why-details-is-not-an-accordion/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://daverupert.com/2019/12/why-details-is-not-an-accordion/\" target=\"_blank\"> you know it‚Äôs not an accordion </a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-rf-blocks-library-accordion accordion-container\" id=\"accordion90\" data-allow-toggle=\"true\" data-allow-multiple=\"true\"><div class=\"accordion\"><span class=\"accordion-index\" style=\"display:none\">0</span><div class=\"accordion__heading\"><button aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"accordion-trigger\" aria-controls=\"sectaccordion900\" id=\"accordionaccordion900id\"><span class=\"accordion-title accordion__title\">An accessible accordion, that was tough to find for Gutenberg.<span class=\"accordion-icon\"></span></span></button></div><div id=\"sectaccordion900\" role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"accordionaccordion900id\" class=\"accordion-panel\" hidden><div>I know that I have left the blue focus style, and some interesting style choices, but these are free to be modified at your discretion üëç</div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I searched and searched and each find was in my view not sufficient, even the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/21584\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/21584\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress team are talking about it</a>, and they even suggest a <details> component. I think the Details HTML should be used, but not for the purpose of what it‚Äôs illustrating.
