You’re creative problem solving to complex problems. That site isn’t going to get you anywhere but hinder you and make you look unprofessional.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🤷</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, yeah OK my website probably doesn’t look as interesting as some others. BUT I bet my website doesn’t track you everywhere you go? Or slow your experience because i’m loading that really important js library that I need to include to make the text appear to “pop”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hell this site isn’t even fully finished, there are some bugs I need to fix at the time of writing this. (please don’t spam me with it, I already have a Kanban board of bugs and features I need to work on for this website).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least i’m having fun doing this, and hopefully you get a get a kick (or none) out of my thoughts and ramblings. There will be some tutorials here – <strong>I promise.</strong> If you can look past the rather boring website design<s> that i’ve actually spent a lot of time meticulously working on a UI that represents “me” and my view on modern web design and that users don’t actually care if your site is flashy, but that it “just works” and is fast</s>… there are some tutorials on here…in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although admittedly, i’m probably not doing myself any favours, but i’d like to think anyone who is reading this probably appreciates the fact that i’m a front end engineer who has taken the consideration not to bombard your experience with 2 popups, and some peculiar user experience (subjective, of course).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I once worked on a website for a client, and I had to add a tone of animations (shout out to <a href=\"https://wowjs.uk/\">wowjs</a>) and it just killed me inside. The site was really well designed…but I had to add animations. I think I died a little inside. Surprisingly, it was a hit. I couldn’t understand why it was. But it worked. Ecommerce is a strange world sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess i’m more of a minimalist by preference. That doesn’t mean I can’t create your layout with flexbox, or develop a (rather cool) animation in canvas, or code a complicated React driven UI. </p>\n","featuredImage":null},"nextPage":null,"previousPage":{"title":"I don’t know about Gutenberg.","uri":"/i-dont-know-about-gutenberg/"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNTk=","previousPage":"cG9zdDoxMzY="}},"staticQueryHashes":["1434331875"]}
