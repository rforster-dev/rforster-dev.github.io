They’ve done a fantastic job in improving the interface and post creation process to give more control back to the user – that’s great. But what does that mean for devs like me who need to develop themes that need safety nets for design?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, this theme i’ve built entirely on Gutenberg, it feels pretty flexible in that sense – but I know what i’m doing. I wouldn’t expect Joe Blogs to understand or even comprehend the layout aspect half the time. But with Gutenberg, they sort of have to – unless you use Templates and restrict them on what blocks they can use but that defeats the point, doesn’t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, it felt half the time I was battling the editor to move and group blocks in the way I want, even the custom blocks i’ve developed <strong>(tutorial coming soon)</strong> for this theme just didn’t seem to want to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But whilst writing this article, it actually feels pretty nice, and looks cool also. Using only basic blocks though it would feel like that. Introducing UI block interactions is a different story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would I choose Gutenberg again to develop websites for customers? Not sure yet, it’s a judgement call on how tech savy they are. If they aren’t then I would use my beloved Advanced Custom Fields PRO plugin that I’ve been using for years – you can do some really neat and intelligent stuff with it to help offload the burden to end users who “just want a flashy site”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accepting that Gutenberg is here to stay is hard for me, I like being able to develop bespoke systems with the use of ACF Pro and various other tools/custom PHP. It’s quite a mind shift personally and i’ve sort of been relearning how to do WordPress development whilst using Gutenberg. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it over engineered? Possibly. Is it perfect? No. Definitely not. Is it a step in the right direction – yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","featuredImage":null},"nextPage":{"title":"Why does my website not look cool?👉 😎👉","uri":"/im-fine-with-my-site-not-being-flashy-and-wizzy/"},"previousPage":null},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxMzY=","nextPage":"cG9zdDoyNTk=","previousPage":"cG9zdDoxNzg="}},"staticQueryHashes":["1434331875"]}
