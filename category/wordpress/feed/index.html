<h2>The problem.</h2>



<p>I was looking for a plugin that created an <em>accessible </em>accordion for Gutenberg editor considering its a common request for UI. I must have spent hours, days looking for 1, and I found a few&#8230;however, they all used the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> tag, which if you are in the know &#8211;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://daverupert.com/2019/12/why-details-is-not-an-accordion/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://daverupert.com/2019/12/why-details-is-not-an-accordion/" target="_blank"> you know it&#8217;s not an accordion </a>.</p>



<p></p>



<div class="wp-block-rf-blocks-library-accordion accordion-container" id="accordion90" data-allow-toggle="true" data-allow-multiple="true"><div class="accordion"><span class="accordion-index" style="display:none">0</span><div class="accordion__heading"><button aria-expanded="false" class="accordion-trigger" aria-controls="sectaccordion900" id="accordionaccordion900id"><span class="accordion-title accordion__title">An accessible accordion, that was tough to find for Gutenberg.<span class="accordion-icon"></span></span></button></div><div id="sectaccordion900" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordionaccordion900id" class="accordion-panel" hidden><div>I know that I have left the blue focus style, and some interesting style choices, but these are free to be modified at your discretion <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f44d.png" alt="👍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></div></div></div></div>



<p>I searched and searched and each find was in my view not sufficient, even the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/21584" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/21584" target="_blank">WordPress team are talking about it</a>, and they even suggest a &lt;details&gt; component. I think the Details HTML should be used, but not for the purpose of what it&#8217;s illustrating. Thankfully, they are launching their own as part of the Gutenberg editor which will be interesting to see.</p>



<h2>If you can&#8217;t find it, develop your own.</h2>



<p>I decided that I&#8217;d take the plunge and develop an actual accordion toggle, that uses the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/accordion/accordion.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/accordion/accordion.html" target="_blank">WCAG accordion example</a>, so you know it&#8217;s accessible and to a good standard already.</p>



<p>Feel free to use it, fork it, clone it, but please <strong><em>don&#8217;t just copy it and say it&#8217;s your own work &#8211; contribute to it :)!</em></strong></p>



<h2>Download link</h2>



<p><a href="https://github.com/rforster-dev/gutenbergblock-accordion" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/rforster-dev/gutenbergblock-accordion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Download the gutenberg accordion plugin.</a></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[To Gutenberg, or not to Gutenberg. Do I like it or do I not like it. Should you use it or should you not use it. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I&#8217;ll start this off by saying, hats off to the WordPress dev team. They&#8217;ve done a fantastic job in improving the interface and post creation process to give more control back to the user &#8211; that&#8217;s great. But what does that mean for devs like me who need to develop themes that need safety nets for design?</p>



<p>Well, this theme i&#8217;ve built entirely on Gutenberg, it feels pretty flexible in that sense &#8211; but I know what i&#8217;m doing. I wouldn&#8217;t expect Joe Blogs to understand or even comprehend the layout aspect half the time. But with Gutenberg, they sort of have to &#8211; unless you use Templates and restrict them on what blocks they can use but that defeats the point, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p>Honestly, it felt half the time I was battling the editor to move and group blocks in the way I want, even the custom blocks i&#8217;ve developed <strong>(tutorial coming soon)</strong> for this theme just didn&#8217;t seem to want to work.</p>



<p>But whilst writing this article, it actually feels pretty nice, and looks cool also. Using only basic blocks though it would feel like that. Introducing UI block interactions is a different story.</p>



<p>Would I choose Gutenberg again to develop websites for customers? Not sure yet, it&#8217;s a judgement call on how tech savy they are. If they aren&#8217;t then I would use my beloved Advanced Custom Fields PRO plugin that I&#8217;ve been using for years &#8211; you can do some really neat and intelligent stuff with it to help offload the burden to end users who &#8220;just want a flashy site&#8221;. </p>



<p>Accepting that Gutenberg is here to stay is hard for me, I like being able to develop bespoke systems with the use of ACF Pro and various other tools/custom PHP. It&#8217;s quite a mind shift personally and i&#8217;ve sort of been relearning how to do WordPress development whilst using Gutenberg. </p>



<p>Is it over engineered? Possibly. Is it perfect? No. Definitely not. Is it a step in the right direction &#8211; yes.</p>
