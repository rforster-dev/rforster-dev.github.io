					<description><![CDATA[You were probably expecting the Ferrari of websites, but you got a Vauxhall Corsa. Reliable, consistent and doesn't break.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&#8220;But if you want to attract employers, you need to showcase your talents, your dev skills. You&#8217;re creative problem solving to complex problems. That site isn&#8217;t going to get you anywhere but hinder you and make you look unprofessional.&#8221;</p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f937.png" alt="ðŸ¤·" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>I mean, yeah OK my website probably doesn&#8217;t look as interesting as some others. BUT I bet my website doesn&#8217;t track you everywhere you go? Or slow your experience because i&#8217;m loading that really important js library that I need to include to make the text appear to &#8220;pop&#8221;.</p>



<p>Hell this site isn&#8217;t even fully finished, there are some bugs I need to fix at the time of writing this. (please don&#8217;t spam me with it, I already have a Kanban board of bugs and features I need to work on for this website).</p>



<p>At least i&#8217;m having fun doing this, and hopefully you get a get a kick (or none) out of my thoughts and ramblings. There will be some tutorials here &#8211; <strong>I promise.</strong> If you can look past the rather boring website design<s> that i&#8217;ve actually spent a lot of time meticulously working on a UI that represents &#8220;me&#8221; and my view on modern web design and that users don&#8217;t actually care if your site is flashy, but that it &#8220;just works&#8221; and is fast</s>&#8230; there are some tutorials on here&#8230;in time.</p>



<p>Although admittedly, i&#8217;m probably not doing myself any favours, but i&#8217;d like to think anyone who is reading this probably appreciates the fact that i&#8217;m a front end engineer who has taken the consideration not to bombard your experience with 2 popups, and some peculiar user experience (subjective, of course).</p>



<p>I once worked on a website for a client, and I had to add a tone of animations (shout out to <a href="https://wowjs.uk/">wowjs</a>) and it just killed me inside. The site was really well designed&#8230;but I had to add animations. I think I died a little inside. Surprisingly, it was a hit. I couldn&#8217;t understand why it was. But it worked. Ecommerce is a strange world sometimes.</p>



<p>I guess i&#8217;m more of a minimalist by preference. That doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t create your layout with flexbox, or develop a (rather cool) animation in canvas, or code a complicated React driven UI. </p>
