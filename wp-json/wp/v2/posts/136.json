They&#8217;ve done a fantastic job in improving the interface and post creation process to give more control back to the user &#8211; that&#8217;s great. But what does that mean for devs like me who need to develop themes that need safety nets for design?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, this theme i&#8217;ve built entirely on Gutenberg, it feels pretty flexible in that sense &#8211; but I know what i&#8217;m doing. I wouldn&#8217;t expect Joe Blogs to understand or even comprehend the layout aspect half the time. But with Gutenberg, they sort of have to &#8211; unless you use Templates and restrict them on what blocks they can use but that defeats the point, doesn&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, it felt half the time I was battling the editor to move and group blocks in the way I want, even the custom blocks i&#8217;ve developed <strong>(tutorial coming soon)<\/strong> for this theme just didn&#8217;t seem to want to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But whilst writing this article, it actually feels pretty nice, and looks cool also. Using only basic blocks though it would feel like that. Introducing UI block interactions is a different story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would I choose Gutenberg again to develop websites for customers? Not sure yet, it&#8217;s a judgement call on how tech savy they are. If they aren&#8217;t then I would use my beloved Advanced Custom Fields PRO plugin that I&#8217;ve been using for years &#8211; you can do some really neat and intelligent stuff with it to help offload the burden to end users who &#8220;just want a flashy site&#8221;. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accepting that Gutenberg is here to stay is hard for me, I like being able to develop bespoke systems with the use of ACF Pro and various other tools\/custom PHP. It&#8217;s quite a mind shift personally and i&#8217;ve sort of been relearning how to do WordPress development whilst using Gutenberg. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it over engineered? Possibly. Is it perfect? No. Definitely not. Is it a step in the right direction &#8211; yes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To Gutenberg, or not to Gutenberg.
