You&#8217;re creative problem solving to complex problems. That site isn&#8217;t going to get you anywhere but hinder you and make you look unprofessional.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x1f937;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, yeah OK my website probably doesn&#8217;t look as interesting as some others. BUT I bet my website doesn&#8217;t track you everywhere you go? Or slow your experience because i&#8217;m loading that really important js library that I need to include to make the text appear to &#8220;pop&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hell this site isn&#8217;t even fully finished, there are some bugs I need to fix at the time of writing this. (please don&#8217;t spam me with it, I already have a Kanban board of bugs and features I need to work on for this website).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least i&#8217;m having fun doing this, and hopefully you get a get a kick (or none) out of my thoughts and ramblings. There will be some tutorials here &#8211; <strong>I promise.<\/strong> If you can look past the rather boring website design<s> that i&#8217;ve actually spent a lot of time meticulously working on a UI that represents &#8220;me&#8221; and my view on modern web design and that users don&#8217;t actually care if your site is flashy, but that it &#8220;just works&#8221; and is fast<\/s>&#8230; there are some tutorials on here&#8230;in time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although admittedly, i&#8217;m probably not doing myself any favours, but i&#8217;d like to think anyone who is reading this probably appreciates the fact that i&#8217;m a front end engineer who has taken the consideration not to bombard your experience with 2 popups, and some peculiar user experience (subjective, of course).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I once worked on a website for a client, and I had to add a tone of animations (shout out to <a href=\"https:\/\/wowjs.uk\/\">wowjs<\/a>) and it just killed me inside. The site was really well designed&#8230;but I had to add animations. I think I died a little inside. Surprisingly, it was a hit. I couldn&#8217;t understand why it was. But it worked. Ecommerce is a strange world sometimes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess i&#8217;m more of a minimalist by preference. That doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t create your layout with flexbox, or develop a (rather cool) animation in canvas, or code a complicated React driven UI. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You were probably expecting the Ferrari of websites, but you got a Vauxhall Corsa.
